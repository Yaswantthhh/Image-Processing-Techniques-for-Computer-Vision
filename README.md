#🧠 Image Processing & Preprocessing Techniques for Computer Vision#
This project demonstrates fundamental image preprocessing operations using Python, OpenCV, and PIL — the essential steps used to prepare images for computer vision and machine learning models.
It walks through how to load, transform, and enhance images before feeding them into algorithms or neural networks.

🧩 Project Overview
The notebook performs step-by-step image preprocessing operations including:
📏 Resizing – Standardizing image dimensions for consistent model input.
🌗 Grayscale Conversion – Reducing image complexity by removing color information.
🧹 Gaussian Blurring – Removing noise and smoothing images.
⚡ Histogram Equalization – Enhancing contrast to highlight features.
⚫ Thresholding – Converting images to binary format for segmentation or feature extraction.
